# Gaussian Elimination

## AIM:
To write a program to find the solution of a matrix using Gaussian Elimination.

## Equipments Required:
1. Hardware – PCs
2. Anaconda – Python 3.7 Installation / Moodle-Code Runner

## Algorithm
## Step:1. 
Import the numpy module to use the built-in functions for calculation.
## Step:2. 
Import the sys module to use the built-in functions.
## Step:3. 
Get input from the user for number of rows and add it by 1 for number of columns.
## Step:4. 
Using np.zeros() set the matrix as null matrix.
## Step:5.
Using for loop get input from the user for each element in the matrix.
## Step:6.
Using for loop we can perform the elementary row operations and find the final matrix.
## Step:7.
Print the values by solving the matrix using for loop with 2 point precision.
## Step:8.
End the program.
## Program:
```
